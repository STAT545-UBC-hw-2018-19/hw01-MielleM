###Who are you, anyway?

####A bit about myself

I'm a MSc student in the department of Geography, using GIS to address issues in environmental health. 
In this course, I'm hoping to explore the capabilities of R for geographic data visualization and spatial analysis. 


@MielleM if you like maps or want to talk about data viz!
